```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  // Ensure this component is within the 'pages' directory or a dynamically routed page.
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/">
        <a>Home</a>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>About</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
To fix this, ensure that `MyComponent` is placed within the `pages` directory or another appropriate location that's part of the Next.js routing system.  Alternatively, consider refactoring the application architecture to use the `Link` component only where it's intended to be used.
