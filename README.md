# Inconsistent Next.js Link Component Behavior Outside Pages Directory

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the Next.js `Link` component.  The bug occurs when the `Link` component is used outside of the `pages` directory or within a component that isn't part of a dynamically generated page. In such cases, the generated links might not function as expected, leading to unexpected routing behavior or broken links.

## Bug Description

The `Link` component is designed to work seamlessly within the Next.js routing system. However, its behavior is not well-defined when used in other contexts.  The issue is often difficult to diagnose because the problem doesn't manifest as an error, but rather as unexpected navigation or a lack of navigation when a link is clicked.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to the application in your browser. Notice that the links within the main component, while rendered correctly, do not behave as expected when clicked.

## Solution

The best way to avoid this issue is to ensure that you only use the `Link` component within components that are directly or indirectly within the `pages` directory, or within the context of a dynamically generated page.
